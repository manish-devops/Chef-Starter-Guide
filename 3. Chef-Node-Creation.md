###Bootstrap

The process of installing chef-client on nodes is called bootstrap. This process is executed to establish connectivity between chef server and chef node. This process is executed from [chef-workstation](https://github.com/ManishDevops/Chef-Starter-Guide/blob/master/Chef-Workstation-Setup.md). 

This process can be broadly categorised in following three steps

      1. Chef Workstation connects with Chef Node and downloads [chef-client](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-client/). 
      2. Downloaded chef client is installed on Chef Node. 
      3. Key Generation and Chef-node registration on chef server.

All we need to do is to run following command from Chef Workstation "C:chef-repo" directory.

#####For Linux Nodes

      knife bootstrap IP -x username -P password --sudo
      or
      knife bootstrap FQDN -x username -P password --sudo

#####For Windows Nodes
You need to enable winrm on your chef node. Execute following commands on Windows machines to enable and configure winrm.

    winrm quickconfig -q
    Execute following commands from your administrative Power Shell
    set-item wsman:\localhost\shell\maxmemorypershellmb 1024
    set-item wsman:\localhost\MaxTimeoutms 300000
    set-item wsman:\localhost\service\allowunencrypted $true
    set-item wsman:\localhost\service\auth\basic $true
  
Now execute following command to bootstrap your windows node

    knife bootstrap windows winrm -x username -P password
    

    
###Special Cases:

#####When you have internet connectivity on your node but you are behind corporate proxy. 

    knife bootstrap windows winrm IP -x username -P password --bootstrap-proxy *proxy server*
    
#####When you are not allowed to connect to internet.
In this situation, you need to download chef-client and keep it at some share folder or central repository which is accessible from your chef node. Then run following command from Chef Workstation

    knife bootstrap windows winrm IP -x username -P password --bootstrap-no-proxy domain --msi-url "Central_repository_URL"
    or
    knife bootstrap windows winrm IP -x username -P password --bootstrap-no-proxy domain --msi-url "Shared_Folder_Location"


To check whether your node is bootstrapped or not, run following command from [Chef-workstation](https://github.com/ManishDevops/Chef-Starter-Guide/blob/master/Chef-Workstation-Setup.md) C:/chef-repo directory

    knife node-list
Your node name should appear when you execute this command.

That's it. You are now ready to write [recipes](https://github.com/ManishDevops/Chef-Starter-Guide/blob/master/4.%20Chef-Writing-Recipes.md) and start managing your nodes.
