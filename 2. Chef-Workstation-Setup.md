### Chef Workstation Installation
Many developers use Chef Management Console in this process. This will make your process easier and you will get a webui but it is a Featured Component. If you want to use Chef Management Console then you can use 25 nodes for free and to use more than 25 nodes, you will have to purchase license.I am not going to use Chef Management Console in my process.

I am using a windows machine(my personal laptop) as workstation.

You need to follow following steps to install workstation.

    1. Download Chef Development Kit
    2. Install Chef Development Kit
    3. Download/Create chef-repo
    4. Configure chef-repo
    5. Configure knife.rb
    
##### 1. Download Chef Development Kit
Go to [this](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) link and select chef dk according to your workstation machine. 


##### 2. Install Chef Development Kit
Follow the steps in the installer and install the Chef development kit to your machine. The Chef development kit is installed to /opt/chefdk/ on UNIX and Linux systems. 
After installation is finished, open command prompt and run following command

    chef verify
    
This command will run verification for 'test-kitchen', 'tk-policyfile-provisioner', 'chef-client', 'chef-provisioning', 'chefspec', 'generated-cookbooks-pass-chefspec', 'rubocop', 'fauxhai', 'knife-spork', 'kitchen-vagrant', 'package installation', 'openssl', 'inspec'. *chef verify* should pass successfully for all components.

This [link](https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html#uninstall-the-chef-dk-title) gives a good description of installing and uninstallting Chef Development Kit.


##### 3. Download/Create chef-repo

You can either install git and clone chef-repo from [this](https://github.com/chef/chef-repo) location or you can directly click on [download zip](https://github.com/chef/chef-repo/archive/master.zip) and extract it to any directory.

This method will work but it is depricated now. The new method is to create chef-repo using development kit. Execute one simple command to generate chef-repo
	
	Open Chef Development Kit in administrative command prompt and execute following two commands
	cd C:\
	chef generate repo chef-repo
	
This will generate chef-repo in C:\ directory.
	

##### 4. Configure chef-repo
Once the above downloaded package is extracted (I have extracted it in C drive so my folder structure looks like this **C:/chef-repo**), goto *C:/chef-repo* and create a blank folder named **.chef**.

Windows user can run following command from their administrator command prompt

    cd C:\chef-repo
    mkdir .chef
Once *.chef* folder is created, paste **admin.pem** and **primaryorg-validator.pem** files into this folder. To copy these files you will have to go to your chef server and check in the directory where you installed chef server. 

**Note:** We created these two pem files while creating user and organization.

##### 5. Configure knife.rb
Goto *C:/chef-repo/.chef* folder and create **knife.rb** file in it. Insert following entries in this file:

    current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
	log_level                :info
	log_location             STDOUT
	node_name                "admin"
	client_key               "E:/chef-repo/.chef/admin.pem"
	validation_client_name   "primaryorg-validator"
	validation_key           "E:/chef-repo/.chef/primaryorg-validator.pem"
	chef_server_url          "https://hostname/organizations/primaryorg"
	syntax_check_cache_path  "#{ENV['HOME']}/^.chef/syntaxcache"
	cookbook_path            ["E:/chef-repo/cookbooks"]


Replace hostname with yyour chef-server hostname. Save the file. Now your workstation can communicate with your chef-server. 

Note: We will be using knife command here after. Either put the chef-repo folder location in your environment variable or execute all knife commands from *C:/chef-repo* directory.
