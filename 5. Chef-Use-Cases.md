Let's start with basic use cases and build bigger scenarios using those use cases.

### Use Case 1: Environment variables check
**Problem Statement:** A lot of builds of team XYZ are failing and the reason is there environment variables. They use their servers in various processes and they need to change environment variables (like: version of Java) according to the need. So whenever they trigger a build, most likely they will face this problem again. Just to make sure that their build will not face problem due to wrong environment variables, they need to manually go to their servers and check each environment variable. This is definitely not an easy job and it consumes a lot of time.

**Approach using Chef:** Before starting any build on servers, a recipe will be executed which will check the required environment variables. If the variables are defined correctly, the recipe will pass. If the variables are not defined correctly, there are two possibilities: 
```
i. the script can through an error telling which env variable is not defined correctly 
ii. The recipe can fix the environment variables and send the updated report. After this check is finished, the team can go ahead with desired installation. 
```

### Use Case 2: Installation
**Problem Statement:** Team XYZ uses tomcat as their Application Server. They need to install it just before testing and uninstall it after testing. This exercise is time consuming and repetative. A small error while installation may lead to a deployment failure.

**Approach using Chef:** After build, chef-client need to be invoked to install tomcat on complete Testing environment. After installation, chef will set environment variables as well accordingly. At the end of the deployment and test process, chef recipe will again be invoked and tomcat will be uninstalled from the machines.

### Use Case 3: Deployment
**Problem Statement:** Deployment of any application involves certain standard steps. In most of the cases those steps are repetitive and standard. Typically teams follow following steps:
```sh
i.  Create folders 
ii. Copy deployables in those folders
iii.Start service
iv. Execute certain executables. 
```
This makes it monotonous and time consuming. The probability of error is more if this work is done manually.

**Approach using Chef:** One recipe can be created to do all these processes. The recipe will look into a json file for parameters. That json file is supposed to be updated according to the needs.

### Use Case 4: Server Provisioning
**Problem Statement:** Team XYZ needs 10 servers just for testing once in a week. For remaining 6 days the servers are kept idle. Hence the servers are not being used for a long time still the team is bearing cost involved in those servers.

**Approach using Chef:** Chef can be used aptly in this scenario. Either we can consider cloud servers or on premises virtual machines. Just before testing the team is supposed to execute server provision cookbook. That cookbook will contain recipes for server provisioning, bootstrapping and installation of prerequisites. As soon as the cookbook finishes its action the server will be ready with all prerequisites. Now the team can use them as testing servers. After the completion of this test the team needs to run another cookbook which will decommission that entire environment.
