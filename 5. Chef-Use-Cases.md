Chef is capable of delivering value in multiple scenarios. We will discuss the approach for following four use cases

```sh
1. Patching
2. Server Provisioning
3. Environment readiness
4. Configuration Management
```

The first step of working on any of these environment is to check-in a perfect recipe into github which has passed peer review, build, code check and other necessary gates.


###1. Patching
Following steps need to be followed in the process of patching:

1. Check for the latest stable patches.
2. Create recipe to Import them.
3. Create atleast three environments(viz. Test, Pre-Production and Production) using n number of nodes.
4. Execute the recipe in Test environment.
5. Execute tests to check the working of those patches.
6. On success push the recipe to Pre-Production environment.
7. Run tests to check the working.
8. On success push the recipe to Production environment.


###2. Server Provisioning
Server provisioning can be broadly devided into two parts
```sh
i.  On Premises
ii. On Cloud
```
#####i. On Premises
There are many softwares which provide facility to provision virtual machines. Few of them are VMware, Oracle Virtual Box and zen. We will discuss server provisioning through chef using VM Ware. To understand this we need to have basic understanding of VM ware.

**VMWare Basics**:
VMWare Workstation is a Virtulization platform, where you can host and manage multiple virtual machines. There are two components of VMWare workstation. VMWare Server(also known as VMWare Workstation) and VMWare client. VMWare server is installed on the host server. Either we connect extra resources to this machine to provide storage or we use the same machine. Another entity is VMWare Client. We can install VMWare Client in any remotely accessible machine, this client will be responsible to manage the VMWare Workstation. We can have multiple VMWare clients for one VMWare workstation.

Coming back to Chef. Chef client need to be installed on the same machine where VMWare client exists. Install VSphere plugin on your chef server. This plugin is responsible to connect with VMWare API. Now using certain commands from chef workstation we can create, delete or edit Virtual machines in VMWare. For more details on VSphere click [here](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/chef-provisioning-vsphere).

(Chef metal)[https://www.chef.io/blog/2014/03/04/chef-metal-0-2-release/] can be used to provision bare metal servers.

#####ii. On Cloud
There are various CLoud service providers. AWS, Azure and Bluemix are few of them. Provisioning machines is farely staright forward job in these providers.
