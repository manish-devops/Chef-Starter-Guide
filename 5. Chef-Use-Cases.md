Chef is capable of delivering value in multiple scenarios. We will discuss the approach for following four use cases

```sh
1. Patching
2. Server Provisioning
3. Environment readiness
4. Configuration Management
```

The first step of working on any of these environment is to check-in a perfect recipe into github which has passed peer review, build, code check and other necessary gates.


###1. Patching
Following steps need to be followed in the process of patching:

1. Check for the latest stable patches.
2. Create recipe to Import them.
3. Create atleast three environments(viz. Test, Pre-Production and Production) using n number of nodes.
4. Execute the recipe in Test environment.
5. Execute tests to check the working of those patches.
6. On success push the recipe to Pre-Production environment.
7. Run tests to check the working.
8. On success push the recipe to Production environment.


###2. Server Provisioning
